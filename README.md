TRACELESS PROTOCOL (Alpha v0.0.1 - CLI Edition)
=================================================
Status: Polygon Amoy Testnet
Build: Public Alpha

[ INTRODUCTION ]
Traceless is not a messenger. It is a protocol for permanent, uncensorable communication built on the Polygon blockchain.

Unlike traditional apps (Telegram, Signal), Traceless has no central servers.
Every message is an encrypted transaction.
Every word is carved into the blockchain forever.
We cannot ban you. We cannot delete your messages. We cannot read them.

[ USE CASES ]
1. The Digital Dead Drop: Unstoppable delivery for journalists and sources.
2. Dispute Resolution: Reveal your keys to a third party to mathematically prove what was said.
3. Digital Inheritance: Leave instructions that will persist as long as the blockchain exists.

[ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE ]
- Encryption: AES-GCM (Client-side).
- Key Exchange: ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman).
- Transport Layer: Polygon Network (EVM).
- Data Storage: Transaction Input Data (HEX).

[ QUICK START GUIDE ]

WARNING: This Alpha version runs on the Polygon AMOY Testnet.
Messages are FREE. Do NOT use real MATIC.

STEP 1: LAUNCH
Run `traceless.exe`. Select "Create New Wallet".
SAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE. If you lose it, your identity is gone forever.

STEP 2: GET FUEL (GAS)
You need testnet tokens to pay for blockchain gas.
1. Copy your address from the menu (Option 4).
2. Go to a Faucet: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
3. Paste your address and claim free POL (MATIC).

STEP 3: THE HANDSHAKE
To write to someone, you need two things:
1. Their Wallet Address (The Mailbox).
2. Their Public Key (The Lock).
*Ask your contact to send you their Public Key (Option 4 in the menu).*

STEP 4: COMMUNICATE
Select "Write Message". Enter the address and paste the Public Key.
Wait 5-10 seconds for the blockchain to confirm your transaction.

[ ROADMAP ]
- v1.0: GUI Version (Desktop App).
- v1.1: Media Support (IPFS/Arweave).
- v1.2: Local Database for instant loading.

[ DISCLAIMER ]
This software is provided "as is". By using Traceless, you acknowledge that your encrypted messages become a public part of the blockchain history. While the encryption is strong, your anonymity also depends on your operational security (OPSEC).
